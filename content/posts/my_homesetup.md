## 0. hello world - goals

Hi there, I'm loeken - I work as a devops engineer - so i have the great job of playing with various tech stacks for a living. At work my life mostly focuses around the cloud - but in this guide the goal is to rather host stuff on our own with some main goals:

- **I own MY data** ( this does not necessarily mean inconvinience )
- **Security by Compartmentalization**
- **Combine the best of KVMS(proxmox) and Containers(k3s)**
- **Easy to maintain ( ansible )**
- **Update home stack to debian 11** - release date 2021-08-14 ( https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2021/07/msg00003.html )

At first glance it might look a bit overkill and maybe even frightening to some people, but once it's setup properly it isn't complicated to use. If you run a small business/office/company you could apply the same principles, and maybe add some further network seggregation between your departments.

## 0.1. prerequisites & principles 
#### 0.1.1. ssh keys
passwords are not bad, but keys are better ( and in my opinion also more convenient ). so whenever we setup ssh or connect via ssh we want to use a ssh keypair. if you don't have an ssh keypair yet generate one:
```
‚ùØ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in tutorial
Your public key has been saved in tutorial.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:vl6f9UHs7nIAmOF9jEIJcNNf5vQZ91LmDhhjdobxErE loeken@0x00f
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|     ..+o . ++   |
|      . .=  *Bo.+|
|        o *oE*o+=|
|         = =.=+oo|
|        S . o  * |
|       .     .o .|
|        . .   oo |
|         o . +.o.|
|       .o   o +o.|
+----[SHA256]-----+

you ll end up with a id_rsa and a id_rsa.pub - the id_rsa is your private key ( you keep this to your self ) the .pub is the pubkey this one can be copied onto servers to authenticate you.
```
you will be asked to generate a passphrase ( you will be asked to type in this passphrase each time you use this key - so maybe you want to set it to nothing - so you wont be promted ). I currently am using krypt.co ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2q6A0N-ftY ) still - but with the project having been bought by akami i will most likely revert to a normal ssh keypair soon.

#### 0.1.2. infrastructure as code
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning systems through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. think of manually setting up a proxmox server, configuring 20 vms in there and a bunch of software in these 20 vms and then imagine you build a nice configurable ( e.G. version of software ) script for each of these steps and when this script may be useful:
- when you break something and need to "reinstall"
- when you want to test updating some software's versions
- when you plan on building a second cluster for a client/friend
- when zombies attack and you need to relocate quickly but want to take your setup with you

But do not go overboard - do not try to automate everything too much - just because you can and do not reinvent the wheel and build out everything from scratch with bash scripts - rather use some some mix of IT-ochestration software ( like ansible)/containers/backups and a few manual clicks. 

#### 0.1.3. ansible
https://www.ansible.com/ ansible is an "automation platform/it-orchestration software" - in simple words it's a bunch of python stuff that allows us to configure/manage servers over ssh. if you don't know ansible i suggest you take a look at the modules that are available for ansible: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html and you might get an understanding how vast ansible's functionality is.

To get a better understanding of ansible I also recommend this course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goclfp6a2IQ&list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN

#### 0.1.4. github account
https://github.com is a place where you can store code/config files in a versioned manner ( so you can go back/forth between versions). we'll be using github to save our ansible playbooks/roles/configs and most likely use some of it's automation functionality ( github actions ) to trigger some things.

#### 0.1.5. KVMs vs Containers - when use what and why?
Generally speaking it is far easier to maintain/setup things in kubernetes so the majority of things i ll setup like this using already existing helm charts or docker images. For some things it does make more sense to use kvm's - for example my emails or my pxe server - where i want a bit more "isolation". 


## 0.2. network layout
![Create New Template VM](/media/img/home_layout.svg)

#### 0.2.1. security by compartmentalization
the main principle of the setup i would say is **security by compartmentalization**. We expect no network/security to be perfect, if we isolate things into different networks the impact of something would be limited to this section of the network.

#### 0.2.2. why a vm at ovh?
You might ask yourself why i have a gateway in frankfurt and in berlin - my ISP uses a IPv6 stack - i have found out that not everybody runs a ipv6 stack at home so it can become difficult for me to get a connection back home. this is why i've rented a small vps in frankfurt and it connects to my home opnsense via a openvpn tunnel, then i can receive incoming connections on this host and forward it to my home network ( green line = vpn tunnel ). It also "anonymizes" your home ( to a point ... ) -  depending on your requirements you might not want/need it.

#### 0.2.3. parts of the network/devices
###### 0.2.3.1. private network
- range: 192.168.178.0/24
- description: my isp's router ( a fritzbox ) which also creates my internet connection creates a LAN/WAN on the 192.168.178.0/24 range

###### 0.2.3.2. guest network
- range 192.168.179.0/24
- description: the fritzbox creates a second guest network. all devices in this network can use http/https/email protocols. They cannot reach the 192.168.178.0/24 range or other devices within the 192.168.179.0/24 network. They can be reached from devices inside the 192.168.178.0/24 network

###### 0.2.3.3. work network
- range: 172.16.137.0/24
- description: For work i mostly use a laptop with a wired conection to the switch and i also own a "beefy server" that is also connected to the same switch. the server then runs proxmox, a debian based operating system that uses kvm to run multiple virtual machines and manage those virtual machines through a webinterface ( and via ssh ). I've picked the 172.16.137.0/24 range which is part of the 172.16.0.0/12 private address space. I'm using this range for my work network as in my experience this range is not used often and thus does not conflict with a lot.

###### 0.2.3.4. ovh network
- range: 10.250.0.0/24
- description: in the ovh network i only picked a /24 network as common with devices reaching the end user i picked a range from the 10.0.0.0/8 private address space. this for starters will only run a opnsense vm and most likely a pihole too.

###### 0.2.3.5. homeserver
- name: homeserver
- description: As you can see it's a 4U Server with 24 * 3.5" hdd slots. For starters i ve added 4 * 4TB disks and 2 SSDs. My mainboard is a Supermicro X10DRi with 2 CPU(s) 16 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz (2 Sockets). At the moment i use 32GB of ram but I can still throw more into the system if I need to - for now my usage is rather "modest" and 32GB are enough for me.
![Create New Template VM](/media/img/beast.jpg)

###### 0.2.3.6. opnsense
- name: opnsense-berlin
- description: A few years ago i built this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Xn9lQgqf2o&list=PLj8EOFaxOgsQb2N5OhTa88e5TjBAIupBE little hardware firewall. I looked for a cheap passively cooled mini atx mainboard that has 2 network cards and found a matching case. the video explains how i setup pfsense - but as technology evolves i have since switched to using opnsense. In the video i also did use a mechanical hard drive - which turned out to emit some noise which annoyed me. So i ve since ripped out that harddisk and installed opnsense on a usb stick.
The only thing that is a bit "different" from the normal pc is that this mainboard has 2 NICs ( network interface cards ) - one WAN and one LAN.


## 1. dual boot windows/manjaro i3 on laptop - dell xps 9305
I'm gonna start out same as most people with a windows 10 installation by using the dell's recovery image: ( https://www.dell.com/support/home/de-de/drivers/osiso/wt64a )
once windows is installed i ll shrink the partition down to 80GB and use the rest for linux and setup a dual boot configuration - in my experience it's usually easier to have a windows installed and then add the linux next to it.

## 2. opnsense installation & openvpn tunnel

#### 2.0 opnsense installation ovh ( public cloud)

at the top left you can select the zone in which to start the virtual machine in.

###### 2.0.1. create ovh virtual network ( 10.250.0.0/24 )
During your account creation with ovh you ll create a ovh handle ( XX1234-ovh or similar ) with that handle you can login to the ovh manager ( https://www.ovh.com/manager ) this interface allows you to manager your subscription with ovh. Once logged into the manager you can click on "public cloud" in the top navigation bar ( https://www.ovh.com/manager/public-cloud/ ). In this tutorial series we ll mostly be using this section of ovh. In this section you can also create credentials for https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net/ which is ovh's openstack management interface ( similar to the manager but a few more options ).

###### 2.0.2. upload custom opnsense image via ovh's horizon interface
As a firewall we'll be using opnsense. in ovh's horizon interface we have the option to upload or custom images to be used as operating systems. so I'll head over to https://opnsense.org/download/ download the "nano variant" locally to my laptop to then subsequentally upload it to horizon. the nano variant is designed for usb sticks etc so it will automatically expand.

###### 2.0.3. turn image into volume

###### 2.0.4. create virtual machine at ovh based on volume created in 4.3

###### 2.0.5 network config
```
route add -inet 1.2.3.4/32 -link -iface vtnet0
route add default 1.2.3.4
```
###### 2.0.6 run wizzard

###### 2.0.7 allow temp firewall into webui

###### 2.0.8 interfaces disable ipv6

###### 2.0.9 gateway set default gateway to be persistent

#### 2.1. opnsense installation berlin

###### 2.1.1 run wizzard

###### 2.1.2. opnsense configuration ovh

###### 2.1.3 openvpn server on opnsense ovh for tunnel to opnsense berlin

#### 2.2 opnsense configuration berlin

###### 2.2.1. dhcp / dns

###### 2.2.2. openvpn client on opnsense berlin to uplink to opnsense ovh

## 3. debian 11 on homeserver with full disk encryption ( FDE )

#### 3.1. preparing bootable media & installation
```
cd /tmp
wget https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso
sudo dd if=debian-11.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

- encrypted lvm

make sure to replace sdX with the id of your actual usb stick ( sudo dmesg after plugging in the stick )
#### 3.2. turning debian into proxmox

###### 3.2.1. set /etc/hostname & /etc/hosts

we edit hosts file end enter ip
```
hostname --ip-address
echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-install-repo.list
wget https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian/proxmox-release-bullseye.gpg -O /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/proxmox-release-bullseye.gpg
